Abstract: A periodic visit of an ophthalmologist is crucial for monitoring the eye health regularly. However, the periodic visit to the ophthalmologist may become difficult to handle in the cases of the patient's visual status varies; personal location is far away from the hospital or special cases; such as COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a novel ophthalmologist-and-patient-in-the-loop telemedicine platform is built to remotely examine the corneal surface of the eye. An internet-of-medical-things (IoMT)-based biomedical device is developed with ophthalmologist dashboard and patient interface. The developed biomedical device, Mobile XMI, is validated by testing in the ophthalmologist-and-patient-in-the-loop telemedicine system. The preliminary results showed that the cloud-based teleophthalmology architecture provides a potential tool for the early detection and diagnosis of the corneal related symptoms and diseases. Additionally, the developed medical platform facilitates the remote eye examination of the patients with disability or patients who locate far away from the ophthalmologist or hospital.
