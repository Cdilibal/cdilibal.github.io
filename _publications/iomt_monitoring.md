Abstract: The age of virtual healthcare has created new opportunities to reconsider traditional methods for the preliminary medical examinations and clinical doctor-patient appointments. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical systems for strengthening online services in each medical field. Implementations of novel digital health technologies will dramatically reduce inessential hospital visits of patients for early diagnosis. Moreover, the telehealth based medical platforms will allow the medical services to be time- and cost-effective with convenient media for both patients and doctors. In this study, an internet of medical things (IoMT)-based smart healthcare monitoring platform architecture is proposed to remotely telecommunicate with optimized bandwidth efficiency and latency for a rapid decision-making process management for preliminary diagnosis in a virtual environment. The proposed edge-IoMT computing architecture framework will allow filtering and squeezing of raw medical data of the real-time video footage of the patients with functional algorithms.
